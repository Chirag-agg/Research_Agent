## Search Strategies

1. **Semantic Search**: Use natural language for concept discovery
2. **Citation Chaining**: Follow references for related work
3. **Author Networks**: Find work from key researchers
4. **Recency Bias**: Prioritize recent publications when appropriate

Always include DOI or stable identifiers when available.
Extract methodologies and key statistics from papers.
